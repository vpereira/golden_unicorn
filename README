ztex miner and framework

to build it you will need:

read http://wiki.ztex.de/doku.php?id=en:software:porting#macos_port
java sdk, sdcc, make, freepascal, etc



build order

cd ztex/libusbJava-src/ && make && make install2 (if you are on mac make -f Makefile.macosx)

cd ztex && make distall

root directory: make (I normally copy the result from libusbJava-src to the root directory). I had to rename it to libusbJava64.dylib. I'm sure that is all customizable but I dont have time to do it.
